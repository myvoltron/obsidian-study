# Process Synchronization

## Background
- Processes can execute concurrently
- Shared data access causes inconsistency
- Requires synchronization mechanism
- Example: Producer-Consumer with shared counter

## Race Condition
- Happens when multiple processes access and manipulate shared data concurrently
- Example: `counter++` and `counter--` interleaving causes incorrect results

## Critical Section Problem
- Each process has a section of code (critical section) accessing shared data
- Must satisfy:
  - Mutual Exclusion
  - Progress
  - Bounded Waiting
- Depends on preemptive vs non-preemptive kernel

## Software Solution
### Peterson's Solution
- Two-process solution
- Shared variables: `turn`, `flag[2]`
- Guarantees mutual exclusion, progress, and bounded waiting

## Hardware Support for Synchronization
- Lock-based solutions
- Disabling interrupts (uniprocessor only)
- Atomic hardware instructions
  - `test_and_set`
  - `compare_and_swap`

## Locks
- Busy waiting lock: Spinlock
- Structure:
  - `acquire()` → wait until available
  - `release()` → set available

## Semaphore
- Integer variable for synchronization
- Two atomic operations:
  - `wait()` (P)
  - `signal()` (V)
- Types:
  - Binary semaphore = mutex lock
  - Counting semaphore

## Semaphore Implementation
- Basic: busy waiting
- Advanced: block and wakeup with queue
- Deadlock and starvation possible if used incorrectly

## Classical Synchronization Problems

### Bounded Buffer Problem
- Shared buffer with limited size
- Semaphores:
  - `mutex`, `empty`, `full`

### Readers-Writers Problem
- Multiple readers can read simultaneously
- Only one writer at a time
- Variants:
  - Reader-priority
  - Writer-priority
  - Fair solution

### Dining Philosophers Problem
- Five philosophers with shared chopsticks
- Risk: Deadlock, starvation

## Monitor
- High-level synchronization abstraction
- Only one process active in monitor at a time
- Contains:
  - shared variables
  - procedures
  - initialization
- Condition variables: `x.wait()`, `x.signal()`

### Monitor Implementation
- Use semaphores under the hood
- Support conditional wait with priority (e.g., `x.wait(priority)`)
